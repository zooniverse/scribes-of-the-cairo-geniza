        <h3>Penn</h3>
        <p className="text">The Penn Libraries’ collection of more than 600 medieval manuscript fragments from the Cairo Genizah are based on two sources. The largest part comes from the Library of Dropsie College, the first institution in the world accredited to confer doctoral degrees in Judaic Studies.  According to the internal library records of the College as well as Ben Zion Halper’s Descriptive Catalogue of Genizah Fragments in Philadelphia (1924), the Dropsie holdings derive from gifts made by Cyrus Adler, David W.  Amram, Herbert Friedenwald, Ephraim Lederer, and Mayer Sulzberger, and from a purchase from the widow of Camden M. Cobern, who died in 1920.  Halper classified the fragments into seven subject areas: Bible, Midrash and Talmud, Liturgy, Secular Poetry, Documents and Letters, Philosophy and Kabbalah, and Miscellaneous items.  In 1986, Dropsie was transformed into a post-doctoral research institute called the Annenberg Research Institute (ARI) and later merged with Penn in 1993. In September of 1986, shortly after the establishment of the ARI, an additional small group of fragments were donated to the ARI by Jack Lunzer on behalf of the Board of the Valmadonna Trust.  In 1994, the Dropsie Genizah collection came under the management of the Penn Libraries, joining a second, pre-existing collection of Cairo genizah fragments held at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries’ Rare Book and Manuscript Library, today known as the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts. <a href="http://openn.library.upenn.edu/html/genizah_contents.html" target="_blank">http://openn.library.upenn.edu/html/genizah_contents.html</a></p>

        <h3>JTS</h3>
        <p className="text">The Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary’s holdings of approximately 43,000 Cairo Genizah fragment leaves mainly derived from the acquisition of the collection of Elkan Nathan Adler in 1923.    Adler, in his description of his Hebrew manuscript collections, states that he obtained them in Cairo on trips he made there between 1888 and 1901. Additional fragments were acquired after his death in 1946. The collection was digitally photographed by Ardon bar-Hama and Dwight Primiano, with the philanthropic support of George Blumenthal and a grant from NEH. The collection is temporarily on loan to Princeton University for study while the Seminary builds a new library at its home in New York City.</p>

        <h3>Cambridge</h3>
        <p className="text">In 1896–97 the Cambridge scholar, Dr. Solomon Schechter, with financial help from the Master of St. John’s College, Charles Taylor, arrived in Fustat to examine the Genizah. He received permission from the Jewish community of Egypt to take away what he liked (explaining later, ‘I liked it all’), and he brought 193,000 manuscripts back to Cambridge, where they form the Taylor-Schechter Cairo Genizah Collection (T-S Collection).</p>
        <p className="text">Alongside the T-S Collection, Cambridge University Library is also now the home of the Jacques Mosseri Genizah Collection. Assembled by the successful Cairene businessman, Jacques (Jack) Mosseri in the first decade of the twentieth century, these manuscripts were intended to remain in Egypt as part of the Jewish community’s cultural heritage. However, after Mosseri’s premature death in 1934 and his family’s subsequent departure from Egypt, his eponymous collection disappeared from scholarly view until the 1970s, when it was microfilmed by a team from the Jewish National and University Library. Following recent discussions with members of the Mosseri family, in 2006 this 7000-fragment collection came to Cambridge University Library on a 20-year loan. During its stay in Cambridge, the Mosseri Collection will be conserved and digitised, and a new, detailed catalogue produced.</p>
        <p className="text">At the moment, over 18,000 manuscripts from across the Taylor-Schechter, CUL Or. and Jacques Mosseri Collections are available online, including a substantial number of documents (letters and legal deeds) and liturgical texts (the fruits of a joint project with Ben Gurion University). More manuscripts will be added on a regular basis, until the entire Cambridge Genizah Collection is online.</p>

        <h3>Manchester</h3>
        <p className="text">The University of Manchester Library holds a collection of nearly 15,000 fragments, mostly written in Hebrew and Judeo-Arabic, from the Genizah of the Ben Ezra Synagogue in Old Cairo, purchased from the estate of Dr. Moses Gaster in 1954. About 90% of the items are on paper, the remainder on parchment. The vast majority are very small fragments. They date from the 10th to the 19th century AD and include religious and literary texts, documentary sources, letters, and material relating to grammar, philosophy, medicine, astrology and astronomy.

        <h3>The Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford</h3>
        <p className="text">The collection of Cairo Genizah fragments held at the Bodleian Libraries is one of major collections of its kind. Acquired over the years since 1890 it consists of about 4,000 fragments. Skilful selection ensured that the Bodleian Genizah holdings became one of the most important collections worldwide, featuring Bible, Early Rabbinic literature (Midrash, Mishnah and Talmud), numerous liturgical fragments (Piyyutim and Selichot), many legal documents and letters, both personal and commercial. Its significance lies particularly in the remarkable size of many of the documents. The 4000 fragments comprise about 25,000 pages, amounting to over six pages per fragment, an average unparalleled elsewhere. Some items consist of whole quires, thus deserving the designation manuscripts rather than fragments. Talmud fragments of ten pages or more are no exception in this collection: Tractate Berakhot is represented with a manuscript of 18 leaves (MS. Heb. c. 17/32); of tractate Sukkah 83 leaves (MS. Heb. e 51) are preserved and for tractate Sotah we have 38 leaves (MS. Heb. d. 20/2) at our disposal. An exceptionally exciting example are the twenty pages of Maimonides’s draft manuscript of his Mishneh Torah with corrections in 4 consecutive stages in his own hand (MS. Heb. d 32, fols.47a-56b).</p>
